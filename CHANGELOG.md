## Semantic Versioning

Given a version number `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`, increment the:

 1. `MAJOR` version is for incompatible API changes,
 2. `MINOR` version is when functionality is added which are backwards-compatible, and
 3. `PATCH` version when bug fixes are implemented that are backwards-compatible as well.

Note: The format of the versioning is **based [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/)**,
